# Image Caption Generator Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements an image caption generator using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to generate descriptive captions for images by leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation.

## Project Goals and Objectives

- **Generate Descriptive Captions:** Develop a model that can generate meaningful and accurate captions for images.
- **Model Integration:** Combine CNNs and RNNs to leverage their strengths in image recognition and sequence prediction.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implement robust data preprocessing techniques to prepare images and captions for model training.
- **Model Training:** Train the model on a large dataset to achieve high accuracy and generalization.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language for data analysis and model implementation.
- **TensorFlow and Keras:** Deep learning frameworks for building and training the model.
- **NumPy and Pandas:** Libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib:** Library for data visualization.
- **NLTK:** Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images and their corresponding captions. It is sourced from the Flickr8k dataset, which contains 8,000 images and five captions per image. The images are preprocessed and converted into a format suitable for input into the CNN.

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Resized all images to 299x299 pixels.
   - Normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1].

2. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenized captions into words.
   - Removed punctuation and converted text to lowercase.
   - Created a vocabulary of unique words from the captions.
   - Mapped each word to a unique integer index.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture consists of two main components:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
   - Used for extracting features from images.
   - Pre-trained InceptionV3 model used as the feature extractor.
   - Removed the top layer to obtain image features.

2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):**
   - Used for generating captions from the image features.
   - Implemented using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.
   - Combined the CNN and RNN using an embedding layer and dense layers.

### Model Training

- **Feature Extraction:**
  - Extracted features from images using the InceptionV3 model.
  - Saved the extracted features for efficient training.

- **Caption Generation:**
  - Trained the LSTM model on the extracted features and corresponding captions.
  - Used categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
  - Trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 64.

### Results

The model was evaluated using BLEU scores to measure the quality of generated captions. The BLEU scores indicate how well the generated captions match the ground truth captions.

| Metric         | Score  |
|----------------|--------|
| BLEU-1         | 0.65   |
| BLEU-2         | 0.50   |
| BLEU-3         | 0.40   |
| BLEU-4         | 0.30   |

## Conclusion and Future Work

### Conclusion

The image caption generator successfully combines CNNs and RNNs to generate descriptive captions for images. The model demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in image-to-text translation tasks.

### Future Work

- **Data Augmentation:** Implement data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Integrate an attention mechanism to enhance caption accuracy by focusing on important regions of the image.
- **Larger Datasets:** Train the model on larger datasets to improve performance and robustness.
